# Manchester-United-app

In this project, I created a full-stack web application that enables you to lookup a current Manchester United soccer player and be provided with the player's stats and image.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Heroku
First, I used Node.js and Express to create my own API of Manchester United players and their stats. Then, I used Heroku to host it. Next, I used
HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create my front-end code. Last, I used JS to pull data from my API.

## Optimization
I refractored my code several times by changing the text color from all white to include yellow. This was done so that the text could stand out from the background image and be read easily. I also add more spacing in between paragraphs aid with readibilty.

## Lessons Learned:
This project taught me that I needed to have a way to let browser know that if a search parameter is not met that unkown needs to shown.
